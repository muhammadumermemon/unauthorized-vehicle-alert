<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
    The Vehicle Alert System is a sophisticated application that leverages advanced programming techniques to ensure the security of vehicle access. It is designed to be scalable and flexible, making it suitable for deployment in various environments, from small businesses to large enterprises. The system employs multithreading for efficient processing and utilizes encryption to secure sensitive data.
</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Real-time vehicle monitoring and alerting</li>
    <li>Multithreading for efficient vehicle detection</li>
    <li>Encryption of sensitive data using SHA-256</li>
    <li>Stream-based alert system for asynchronous notifications</li>
    <li>Random vehicle generation for testing and simulation</li>
    <li>Robust error handling and debugging mechanisms</li>
    <li>Scalable architecture for future enhancements</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>
    To set up the Vehicle Alert System on your local machine, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Clone the repository using the following command:</li>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Vehicle-Alert-System.git</code></pre>
    <li>Navigate to the project directory:</li>
    <pre><code>cd Vehicle-Alert-System</code></pre>
    <li>Ensure you have Dart SDK installed. If not, download it from <a href="https://dart.dev/get-dart">here</a>.</li>
    <li>Run the application using the command:</li>
    <pre><code>dart vehicle_alert_system.dart</code></pre>
</ol>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>
    Once the application is running, it will simulate vehicle detection every 2 seconds. The system will randomly generate license plates and determine if they are authorized or unauthorized. Alerts will be printed to the console in real-time.
</p>

<h2 id="advanced-architecture">Advanced Architecture</h2>
<p>
    The architecture of the Vehicle Alert System is designed to be modular and extensible. The core components include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vehicle Class:</strong> Represents individual vehicles with their license plates and authorization status.</li>
    <li><strong>AlertSystem Class:</strong> Manages the list of authorized vehicles and handles the detection and alerting of unauthorized vehicles.</li>
    <li><strong>EncryptionUtil Class:</strong> Provides methods for encrypting sensitive data to enhance security.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The system is built to handle multiple vehicle detections simultaneously, ensuring that performance remains optimal even under heavy loads.
</p>
